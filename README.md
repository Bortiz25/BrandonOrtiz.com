# Personal Portfolio Website 

### About 
Welcome, to my **Personal Website** respository. Hello, my name is Brandon Ortiz and I am an aspiring developer and a sophomore in university studying computer science. This website is meant to showcase my projects, skills, experience, and proficiency in building a website. This site was built from scratch from the ground up.

---

This website was originally build using vanilla **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript**. I later converted the whole site into a single page application using hte Javascript framework **React**. Any future implementations will be created using **React**. There will be future implementations using a personal server and an email system. These are works in progress but you can check out the website as it has grown below.
